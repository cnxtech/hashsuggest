Heading to the office to finish this damn gesture recognizer Ive spent too much time on it
Awesome tip Thanks
Is it because of the abstracted draw procedure where we no longer have control of the draw order
Apparently when Xbox 360 controller thumbsticks get worn out they have problems giving precise diagonal and centered input oh joy
I was always trained to encapsulate members but getterssetters are a pain in the ass Proper coding practices are out the window D
So the recognizer works for the controller input just need to limit the sampling rate to make things perfect

NYC is good good weather finally Enjoying the summer with friends food and some travel Cali not treating you well eh
